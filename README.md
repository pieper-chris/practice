Basic CS concepts (Mathematics will be encorporated). This work will start simple and progress in difficulty (ordered from 1st to 4th year) for personal review of what I've learned throughout my undergraduate degree. This does not reflect the large amount of in-depth and applied course projects/labs completed during this time. Rather, it is a generic summary of broad concepts learned along the way. 

*Although the university's [general policy](https://policy.umn.edu/research/copyright) reiterates that I own the copywrites to my coursework, I decided to upload this coursework to a private repository. As a recent graduate, some coursework in that repo may be subject to misuse by current students (at any university) if my work provides a near solution to current similar assignments. Although I own the copywrites to my work and wouldn't be at fault for this misuse, privatizing recent work is an important responsibility that many cs graduates take on to preserve genuine work in academia. Much of the coursework we have completed is extremely rigorous and difficult, which arguably deserves to be protected. With time, this coursework will lose its relevance for current students in cutting-edge cs programs. When this appears to be the case, I will most likely make my coursework repository public*
